This code will create two arrays, evenNumbers and oddNumbers, both with 50 elements. It will then assign 50 even numbers to the first array and 50 odd numbers to the second array. Finally, it will display both arrays on the screen.

This code uses while and for loops to iterate through an array of numbers. In addition, it displays subarrays consisting of odd/even array elements and displays the array in reverse order. You can run this code to see how it works.

To calculate the sum of the elements in a one-dimensional array, you can use a for loop that will iterate over the elements of the array and add them to the variable containing the sum.
In this code, we create an array arr with real numbers and a variable sum, which initially has a value of 0.0. Next, we iterate over the elements of the arr array using a for loop and add them to the sum variable. Finally, we display the value of the sum variable on the screen.

This code can be modified to work with any array of real numbers. To do this, replace the arr array with another array of real numbers and change its size in the n variable.

To change the sign of all odd elements of an array, you first need to iterate over it using a for loop and check each element for parity. If the element is odd, then we change its sign to the opposite using the *=-1 operator.
In this code, we create an array of integers arr. Next, we iterate over the elements of the array using a for loop. If the current element of the array is odd, then we change its sign to the opposite using the - operation. Finally, we display the modified array on the screen.
